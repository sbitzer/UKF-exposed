# UKF-exposed
A Jupyter-notebook based article investigating (useful parameter settings for) the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

Everything is explained in the notebook file (UKF.ipynb). Additional python files (*.py) contain some code that I outsourced to keep the main article more human-readable. For backwards-compatibility with reading habits I also provide a pdf, but I strongly advise to try the notebook first. Note, especially, that the figures that I included manually in the notebook are missing in the pdf.

Please use Github's issue tracker to post questions and comments.
